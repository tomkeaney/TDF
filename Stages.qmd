## Stage 1

![](profiles/p1.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}
Medium mountain
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}


The sprinters say they have a chance, but good luck fellas. That final climb is hard, so expect the first yellow to go to a climby sprinty type.

:::

## Stage 2

![](profiles/p2.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Medium mountain
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

With the basque start the front end of this tour is loaded with short steep climbs. This stage is hard to predict, as the final climb isn't so steep and summits out 18km from the finish. A reduced group sprint perhaps?
:::

## Stage 3

![](profiles/p3.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Flat
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}
First chance for the pure sprinters. Expect lead-out train carnage.
:::

## Stage 4

![](profiles/p4.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Flat
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

Another one for the fast men. Cavs here, but his team sucks. Can he overtake Mercx for most Tour stage wins of all time?
:::

## Stage 5

![](profiles/p5.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Large mountain
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

Pyrenees time aka Pog land. This is a carbon copy of that stage in 2020 where Pog got his first TDF win. Back then, he droppped everyone on the final climb, they caught him on the 7km of flat valley before the finish, but he went and won the sprint anyway.
:::

## Stage 6

![](profiles/p6.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Extreme mountain
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

The Tourmalet is the most famous climb in the Pyrenees. After an exceptionally hard first week, expect there to be large gc gaps. If one rider looks superior in this first week, the tour could very possibly already be over after this stage.
:::

## Stage 7

![](profiles/p7.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Flat
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

The sprinters are back baby. Get some sleep if you've committed some late night hours the past few days.
:::

## Stage 8

![](profiles/p8.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Flat
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

More pure sprinting.
:::

## Stage 9

![](profiles/p9.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Medium mountain
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

Apparently the summit finish is up a dormant volcano. So far, this tour seems to be gc days or sprinting days with no inbetween. RIP breakaway chances.
:::

## Stage 10

![](profiles/p10.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Medium mountain
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

I've gone early. This has breakaway written all over it. Wouldn't suprise me if the team holding yellow lets a break get 15 mins on this stage, maybe even to purposely lose the jersey for a few days.
:::

## Stage 11

![](profiles/p11.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Flat
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

One more for the sprinters. There's actually far more pure sprinting days than there was last year...
:::

## Stage 12

![](profiles/p12.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Medium mountain
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

Get in the break fellas.
:::

## Stage 13

![](profiles/p13.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Large mountain
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}
: 
Our first foray into the alps. Grand Colombier is harder than 7% avg grade suggests. This is a Jonas 2022 climb.
:::

## Stage 14

![](profiles/p14.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Extreme mountain
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

Big kilajoules day before the final climb and descent. Kilajoules burnt positively correlates with gc gaps so circle this one on the calendar.
:::

## Stage 15

![](profiles/p15.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Large mountain
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

I have no idea what will happen here. None of the climbs are extremely hard but god there's a lot of them. Climby breakaway win?
:::

## Stage 16

![](profiles/p16.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Mountain time trial
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

The only TT of the race and its full of climbing. Assuming they're relevant at all, this is the day Mikel Landa and Enrique Mas die (sorry Spain).
:::

## Stage 17

![](profiles/p17.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Queen stage (stupid mountains)
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

One of those 'must watch live' stages. Col de la Loze was first used in the 2020 tour. Rog and Sepp dropped Pog on that day and we all thought Rog had won the tour. This might be the hardest climb in France.
:::

## Stage 18

![](profiles/p18.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Flat
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

If they've survived the previous stage, this will be one for the sprinters.
:::

## Stage 19

![](profiles/p19.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Miscellaneous
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

I feel like the peloton will not give a fuck about this stage. One for blokes in the break.
:::

## Stage 20

![](profiles/p20.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Large mountains
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}
The final battle for yellow and the dots. Plenty of raid potential. If the time gaps are close this could be awesome.
:::

## Stage 21

![](profiles/p21.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Flat
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

Champs time. Hopefully your sprinter didn't OTL.
