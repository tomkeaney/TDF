## Stage 1

![](profiles_25/stage_1.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}
Chaotic sprint
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

Milan and Merlier have overtaken Phillipsen as the big-boy sprinters, but neither have MVDPs lead-out. Expect huge risks and big crashes. 

:::

## Stage 2

![](profiles_25/stage_2.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Punchy
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}
Now we get our first look at the puncheurs. Every year I think MVDP will clean these, only for some to basically smoke darts mid stage. Will this be the year?
:::

## Stage 3

![](profiles_25/stage_3.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Flat
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}
A second chance for the pure sprinters. Expect lead-out train carnage.
:::

## Stage 4

![](profiles_25/stage_4.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Punchy
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

This one's a bit harder than stage 2. Pog and Jonas could punch away if given the proper lead-out. Remco struggles with positioning in these finishes, so he'll be nervous.

:::

## Stage 5

![](profiles_25/stage_5.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Flat time trial
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}
A rare long tt in the modern tour era. Remco should clean this. Expect him to take a minute plus on Jonas and Pog. On pog, there's controversy around UAE's tt bike. He hated it in the Dauphine and wasn't afraid to show his displeasure. Colnago under the pump.
:::

## Stage 6

![](profiles_25/stage_6.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Punchy
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

A bit of a theme for the first week, with all these hilly finishes. I wonder whether we'll be thinking seriously about Wout here. He won a similar stage in the giro in a 1v1 with Del Toro, but Pog and MVDP are different beasts
:::

## Stage 7

![](profiles_25/stage_7.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Punchy
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

Rise, repeat, just a little longer. Let's go with Pog outsprinting Jonas on this one.
:::

## Stage 8

![](profiles_25/stage_8.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Flat
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

A bit of an uphill sprint but nothing too exciting. Get some sleep.
:::

## Stage 9

![](profiles_25/stage_9.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Flat
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

Another early night.
:::

## Stage 10

![](profiles_25/stage_10.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Mountains
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

The first mountain stage! Much later than last year, perhaps to make it appear like a close tour. This is the litmus test for Jonas. He must stay with Pog to be any chance. On paper also a good stage for Roglic, but Lipowitz might be Red Bull's real GC man.
:::

## Stage 11

![](profiles_25/stage_11.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Punchy punchy
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

Nailed on Pog. Big points for the puncheurs this tour.
:::

## Stage 12

![](profiles_25/stage_12.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Pyrenees mountains 
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

First real test. Remco should be in yellow here, but can he hold off a rampaging UAE and Visma?
:::

## Stage 13

![](profiles_25/stage_13.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Uphill time trial
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}
Interesting one. For whatever reason, I think Jonas wins.
:::

## Stage 14

![](profiles_25/stage_14.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

High pyrenees mountains
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

Big kilajoules day before a very hard final climb. Kilajoules burnt positively correlates with gc gaps so circle this one on the calendar. Expect some aggressive tactics from Visma. Will Simon Yates and Matteo Jorgenson actually matter?
:::

## Stage 15

![](profiles_25/stage_15.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Transition stage
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

Breakaway. Where's Johnny Hoogerland.

:::

## Stage 16

![](profiles_25/stage_16.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

The bald mountain
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

In 2021 Jonas cracked Pog on Ventoux (and Wout somehow won the stage); the only time someone managed to do that for that whole year. Pog still win that tour handily, but for the debutant Jonas it was a sign of things to come. Will history repeat.
:::

## Stage 17

![](profiles_25/stage_17.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Flat
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

This tour is a sprinters hell. Today presents one of their few opportunities. Sprinters should not be highly valued on draft boards this year.
:::

## Stage 18

![](profiles_25/stage_18.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Queen stage
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

Two brutal warm-up climbs lead into the hardest climb in France. Pog uttered his famous "I'm dead" here in 2023 and proceeded to lose 5 minutes. 
:::

## Stage 19

![](profiles_25/stage_19.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Extreme alps
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

I hope it's still close, but my gut says Pog will have it sewn up by this point. So let's list some top 5 GC smokies. I like one of Lenny, Onley or Johannessen if things break right, and Skjelmose to sneak in right at the end after three weeks in witness protection.  
:::

## Stage 20

![](profiles_25/stage_20.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Transition day 
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}
The hard racing is over and it's back to the surviving sprinters.
:::

## Stage 21

![](profiles_25/stage_21.jpg)

::: {.callout-note title="Terrain type"}

Punchy
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Zings summary"}

The Champs returns but with a refreshing twist. This years final stage takes inspiration from the Olympic road race and includes the climb up to Sacre Coeur. Remco won that, so we could be in for an unpredictable, exciting finish. However, will they try?
