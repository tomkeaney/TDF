It’s also the place where Pog’s greatest weakness - climbs over an hour after big kilajoule expenditure - should get taken to task. He showed great improvement in this area at the Giro, but there was no one there that could truly challenge him. Jury;s out on whether the tour will be any different."

If the time gaps are close this could be awesome. It’s worth quickly talking about the teams here: UAE and Bora bring the best climbing teams to a tour since 2012 Sky. UAE is so stacked that a 1, 2, 3 on gc is a real possibility. Bora bring Hindley, Roglic and Vlasov who should all be top 10 level at worst."
